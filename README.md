### App Description	
<blockquote>
Once the user selects their preferred base by clicking on the icon, it will lead them to an ingredients search page. On this page a user will be able to check off which ingredients they have, add them together, and then search for a cocktail. Not all the ingredients work for each base alcohol so if the ingredients you have do not work and do not mix with that base alcohol then no recipe will show up. Instead it will lead you to a google map of nearby stores in your area so you can find ingredients that will work for that base alcohol.
</blockquote>
### More Description
<blockquote>
The homepage has 6 base alcohol options to choose from and a top cocktails button. The top cocktails button leads to a page of the top most popular cocktails to make at home in a 3x3 grid layout. From this page a user can choose any of the 9 cocktail tiles, name and image of drink provided, and it will lead the user to that cocktail’s recipe result page, where the user will get a list of ingredients needed, the mixing ratios, picture of each drink, the recipe, and drink yield as they scroll down the page.
